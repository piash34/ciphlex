About
============
This module helps to cancel created purchase orders. You can also cancel multiple purchase orders from the tree view. You can cancel the purchase order in 3 ways,

1) Cancel Only: When you cancel a purchase order then the purchase order is cancelled and the state is changed to "cancelled".
2) Cancel and Reset to Draft: When you cancel purchase order, first purchase order is cancelled and then reset to the draft state.
3) Cancel and Delete: When you cancel a purchase order then first purchase order is cancelled and then purchase order will be deleted.

We provide 2 options in the cancel purchase orders,

1) Cancel Receipt: When you want to cancel purchase orders and receipt then you can choose this option.
2) Cancel Bill and Payment: When you want to cancel purchase orders and bill then you can choose this option.

If you want to cancel purchase orders, receipts & bill then you can choose both options "Cancel Receipt" & "Cancel Bill and Payment".
