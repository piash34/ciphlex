About
============
Currently, if you have purchased our Theme Basics and you also have a website module (website or frontend) installed then login logout gets conflict so that's the reason we have made this separate app to get compatibility with Backmate Backend Theme Basics with frontend.

Here in this theme, we provide 3 different well-crafted login styles for desktop and mobile views. You can use these styles on the website. Also, you can set the display company icon/logo on the login screen.

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart Ciphlex service (sudo service ciphlex-server restart).
3) Go to your Ciphlex instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
